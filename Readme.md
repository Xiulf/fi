# Shade
A programming language using Purescript style syntax. This project is still very much WIP.

## Todo
- [ ] Windows support
- [ ] Traits, similar to swift protocols and purescript typeclasses
- [ ] Reference counting garbage collection
- [ ] Builtin reference counting garbage collection

## Building
To build the compiler you will need `cargo`, the easiest way to install it is via https://rustup.rs. With cargo installed run:
```shell
$ cargo build
```
